# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
The live app can be accessed at https://activecampaign_contacts_api.hswamina.workers.dev/

The app was developed using React V17, tested using Enzyme and jest, styled using SASS. Other dependencies of the app include Axios and numeral.

## Things to note

  * The total value is the sum of all deal values and other currency values have been converted to US dollars.\
  * Table has an empty filterBar without filter logic implementaion.\
  * The API_Token has not been encrypted. I'm still working on setting up Secret and Environment variables on Cloudflare worker.
